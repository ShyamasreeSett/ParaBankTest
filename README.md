--- Used different types of element location: by locator, by role, by text
--- Wrapped each action in try-catch block to specify error for future debugging
--- Created a Base Test fixture under base folder which acts as an function with common setup for the tests as well as initiates the page objects
--- Created a POJO for the registration form page
--- Used faker to create random user data. Concatenated timestamp to firstname to generate username to make it unique
